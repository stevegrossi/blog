<p>I now do all of my writing in <a href="http://iawriter.com">iA Writer</a> by <a href="http://informationarchitects.net">Information Architects</a>. It’s a blank white screen with one font in one size and one color and it’s absolutely perfect. That it pre-formats <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> makes it the perfect tool for no-fuss, distraction-free writing.</p>
<p>I now do all of my coding in <a href="http://sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a>, as muscular a text editor as I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p>This site and is built on the <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> framework, and hosted on <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.</p>
<p>All text is set in Charis SIL by <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;id=CharisSILfont">SIL International</a>.</p>
<p>Colors borrowed from the <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized color palette</a> by Ethan Schoonover.</p>
<p>Icons are from a great icon font called <a href="http://thedesignoffice.org/project/modern-pictograms/">Modern Pictograms</a> by The Design Office.</p>

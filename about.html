<p>I like a lot of things, but what I like most is figuring things out. I studied philosophy and literature in college, hoping they would help me in that pursuit, but they mostly just introduced me to the glorious, layered complexity of the universe. They did give me some nifty tools for figuring out, but also showed me a whole mess of things that have gone un-figured out for centuries.</p>
<p>Like a lot of folks my age, I started a blog in college because I thought people would be interested in what I had to say (they weren’t, and rightly so.) But unlike a lot of folks, I got quite a bit more interested in tinkering with the blog’s innards than I was in my own writing. I taught myself a number of technologies that make the internet work and began building websites for friends while finishing up my coursework. And when I graduated, I decided to make a go of it building tools for people on the internet.</p>
<p>These days, I'm a developer at <a href="https://www.lessonly.com/">Lessonly</a> building the very best way to train your team online. I mostly work on building websites with Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are pretty much the Ninja Turtles of the internet (Donatello, Leonardo, Michaelangelo, and Raphael, respectively.)</p>
<p>Off the clock, I enjoy reading science fiction, exploring new places on my bicycle, and caring for two miniature humans.</p>

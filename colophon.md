These days, I do all of my writing in the [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor with [the Zen mode plugin](https://atom.io/packages/zen). It’s a blank black screen to be alone with your words and it’s absolutely perfect. That it lets you preview [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as you write it makes it the perfect tool for no-fuss, distraction-free writing.

This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a wonderful tool that turns folders full of Markdown files into a website. It’s hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). <3 Github.

All text is set in Charis SIL by [SIL International](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;id=CharisSILfont).

Colors borrowed from the [Solarized color palette](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) by Ethan Schoonover.

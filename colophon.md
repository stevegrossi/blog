These days, I do all of my writing in [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). “Distraction-Free Mode” is wonderful: it’s a blank black screen to be alone with your words.

This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a wonderful tool that turns folders full of Markdown files into a website. It’s hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). <3 Github.

All text is set in Charis SIL by [SIL International](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;id=CharisSILfont).

Colors borrowed from the [Solarized color palette](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) by Ethan Schoonover.

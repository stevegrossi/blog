[Reset](http://www.lifeinneon.com/games/reset.html) is a text-based in-browser game by Lydia Neon about cyborgs, perception, and kink. It's mostly text-only, though the game stretches the medium by playing ingeniously with color and language. As with the best text adventures, you start out utterly lost and slowly piece together the world you've been thrust into. When you find yourself in a dominant/submissive relationship based on trust, how can you trust when your senses, your memory, and the people you meet prove suspect?

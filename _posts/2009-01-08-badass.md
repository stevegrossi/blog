Thompson's writing constantly surprises with perfect, unlikely metaphors, but he also knows when to let his rhetorical bombast take a back seat to the the actual (though obviously embellished) facts of history. He possesses an inexhaustible stock of synonyms for reproductive organs and destruction, often unleashing several at a time in a gruesome volley of portmanteaus.

Besides the entertainment of reading awesome stories compellingly told, this book's ultimate value is as a series of studies in determination. It becomes clear that the prime virtue of the badass is his or her single-minded pursuit of of excellence (most often in the fields of bloodshed and vengeance).

If you're into this sort of thing, it all began with the author's blog, [Badass of the Week][1].

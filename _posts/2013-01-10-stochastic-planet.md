Best described by Metafilter (where I found it) as "Your Daily Teleport," [Stochastic Planet](http://stochasticplanet.tumblr.com/) is what the internet was made for. Every day, a program chooses a random spot on earth and displays a photo of it. It sounds simple and it is, but the effect is profound. Beginning each morning with a long gaze at a random place on earth fills me at once with a sense of the variety, the possibility, of our celestial home.

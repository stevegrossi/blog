title: "Experiment #1: No Coffee or Alcohol"
description: "I enjoy caffeine and alcohol for their symbolic as well as chemical effects, but giving them up for six weeks wasn’t as difficult as I’d imagined, and even felt good."

## Method

From February 18 to April 5, 2015 (the Lenten season's 46 days), I did not drink coffee or alcoholic beverages. I wasn’t so rigorous as to avoid caffeine entirely (I enjoyed an occasional cup of tea) or all mood-altering chemicals (I consumed sugar, which certainly counts), but my morning and evening consumption rituals were very much different.

## Observations

I was pretty informal about my observations: simply noting in my journal when I noticed or felt something interesting. (For the next experiment, I’ll try to keep a more meticulous log.)

A few days in (Feb 21), I noticed that what I missed about alcohol wasn’t so much its chemical effects, but its symbolic significance:

> During the workday, I catch myself sometimes thinking “Man, this is hard, I can’t wait to have a drink tonight.” Perhaps I never noticed before because the thought would come an go, without being interrupted by the follow-up “Damn, I *can’t* have a drink tonight.” But in many ways it’s easier not drinking. Before, I would be tortured around 4pm: should I have one of those beers in the office fridge, or not? Now, it’s not even worth thinking about. “Not for me” is a powerful thought. It clears up all sorts of ethical quandaries.

Two weeks in (March 5), things were a bit more difficult:

> This was definite harder than the first week, not least because it was a rough week at work.

But just a few days later, I noticed some positive effects:

> I have more energy in the afternoons (no coffee crash) and evening (no wine crash).

The following three weeks went pretty smoothly, and by day 46, I didn’t particularly crave coffee or alcohol. That said, upon completion of the experiment, I did go back to my morning coffee and a drink with dinner most evenings. But at least I had a greater appreciation of what they really meant to me, and their cost in energy.

Chilling for its plausibility, [*Manna*](http://marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm) is a short story about how technology will replace not only blue- but white-collar jobs. The author gives two alternate histories of how this may play out, each depending on weighty decisions we as a society will be forced to make about the purpose of work and people.
